        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong>Demousers, Inc.</strong></em></p>
        <br />
        <p> Born and raised in <a href="https://www.durhamnc.gov/">Durham, North Carolina</a>, Watson always had drive to establish himself as being more than just ridiculously good looking.
          After many modeling gigs, he later established himself as a serious businessman, devoting himself to the work of demousing households.
          Although still relatively new to the game, this wunderkind has already had numerous successes with intelligence gathering, mouse surveillance, and captures.
          He partners with humans for the efficient diposal of mice, and is known to be a key collaborator in maintaining a clean and healthy household. </p></td>
